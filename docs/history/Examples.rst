There's a trio of example Page Templates (with support data) that you
can try out by copying 'PageTemplates/examples/zpt_examples.zexp' into
your 'import' directory and importing it somewhere. One of them shows
off batching, another shows how to make a tree widget, and the third
calls DTML Methods from ZPT.

 I reviewed the included example on batching but the code is a bit
 overwhelming. A brief doc on batching would be most appreciated.

 The Fulton presentation suggested Scripts can be used as URL targets
 instead of PageTemplates themselves. Could someone furnish an example
 of this?
