Speed
  Macro expansion + TAL/TALES could be expensive. Especially if Macro expansion
  must occur everytime before a document is processed with TAL/TALES.

User Complexity
  TAL must be easy for Presentation Designers to grok. Early usage tests must
  be performed (using real designers!).

  TALES must be easy for programmers to grok. The community should take care
  of this ;-)
