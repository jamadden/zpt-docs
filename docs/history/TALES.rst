 Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax
===============================================

TALES is the recommended syntax for :doc:`TAL` expressions. It is an
extensible syntax that allows you to define any number of expression
types and use them together.

See :doc:`../tales` for the current implementation specification.

See :doc:`DiscussTALES` for discussion of proposals for the next specification.
