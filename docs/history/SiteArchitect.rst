 Site Architect
================

The Site Architect is the designer and maintainer of the Zope site.
This person is fluent in Zope (but not necessarily python) and is
responsible for the overall structure and conceptual integrity of the
website.

A Site Architect may direct the :doc:`ZopeProgrammer` and
:doc:`PresentationDesigner` tasking. She may be fluent in DTML, HTML or XML,
although this is not a prerequisite.
