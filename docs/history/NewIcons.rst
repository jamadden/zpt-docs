 New Icons
===========

I find myself really disliking the ZPT icon, so I designed two
replacement icons .The difference between them is subtle, but intended
to suggest other possible color variations.

.. caution:: The links here don't seem to work.

Here are links to the two icons:

http://216.32.129.50/zpt2.gif

The icons try to symbolize the concept of a 'document template' by
adding a dashed line (as in 'stuff goes here') inside a document icon.
In zpt2.gif, the area defined by the dashed line is made slightly more
distinct by changing its color to a pale yellow.

I've created two more variations:

http://216.32.129.50/zpt3.gif

http://216.32.129.50/zpt4.gif

The change I made (besides the color variations) was to take the
'template' area (surrounded by a dashed line), make it a bit smaller
and offset it a bit off the page icon to indicate that 'stuff comes in
from somewhere else'. If anyone has suggestions for further
variations, please let me know.

I'm also wondering if it's possible to display slightly different
icons depending on whether the Page Template defines a macro or not?
This would only be a small usability improvement, but worthwhile, I
think.

 I like the first one. It's clean and understandable, and represent
 Page Templates nicely. The others are a bit too complicated.
