Somebody wants to make structure mode the default.

 I disagree. Structure mode should absolutely not be the default.

 In cases where template developers don't understand the difference
 between text and structure mode, it is much safer to default to text
 mode than to structure mode.

 The current default (text mode) is fail-safe. If the user doesn't
 need structure mode, ZPT will handle things as expected. If the user
 does need structure mode, the mistake is obvious
