================================
 First IRC Chat Session for ZPT
================================

Held: Friday, April 6 at 1pm EST

Hosts: Evan Simpson and Ethan Fremen

Log: http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Chats/zpt_chat_log

Intro
=====

The purpose of this chat is to introduce Zope Page Templates to
members of the Zope community who would like to learn more about them,
and to discuss the features and future development of ZPT.

Preamble
========

Zope Page Templates were created with a very specific audience in
mind: teams of designers and programmers who work closely and
iteratively to design sites.

ZPT is not a replacement for DTML in any sense. It is an alternative
that is meant to be attractive to designers who use WYSIWYG editors,
and the programmers who work with them.
