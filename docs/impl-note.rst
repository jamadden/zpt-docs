.. admonition:: Implementation Note

   In this documentation, you will occasionally see boxes like this
   one. They contain extra information specific to one or more
   implementations of Page Templates.

.. note:: When this document refers to the "page template
		  implementation,", "ZPT implementation" or the
		  "implementation", it means the software that parses and
		  renders page templates to produce output. This could be a
		  framework like Zope, or it could a separate library like
		  :mod:`zope.pagetemplate`. For more information, see
		  :doc:`implementations`.
