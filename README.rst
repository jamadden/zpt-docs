Page Templates provide an elegant templating mechanism that achieves a
clean separation of presentation and application logic while allowing
for designers to work with templates in their visual editing tools
(FrontPage, Dreamweaver, GoLive, etc.).

This is the documentation for the page template languages, including
TAL and METAL.
